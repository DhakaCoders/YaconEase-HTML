                  <blockquote>“I really am impressed by this product.  I take it just before my meals and my digestion has never been more regular.  My doctor has me on a few different medications which can make me constipated often, so YaconEase has been really helpful.  It feels really natural too – when I go it’s not painful and full of cramping.  I use it everyday and I recommend it to anyone.”</blockquote>

                  <blockquote>“I was tired of taking the over the counter stuff.  The gritty mixes were hard to drink, and I didn’t like the way the laxatives made me feel.  My wife got tired of me stalling up the bathroom night after night.  To be honest, I thought I was just getting older and I couldn’t do anything about it.  But my wife told me to start using YaconEase.  She did all the research for me and told me that it would help me have more regular bowel movements.  Well, that’s exactly what it did! I probably go to the restroom now between 2-3 times a day, and because I always take YaconEase before meals, my bowel movements are literally like clock work.  I feel really balanced. My wife says my energy and mood is better – and she’s not lying.  Definitely something that I keep stocked in my medicine cabinet.”</blockquote>

                  <blockquote>“What a great product, through and through.  I never write reviews, but Yacon Ease really blew my socks off.  I bought it because a friend said it helps her not feel so “backed up” and it also got rid of her belly bloat.  When I tried it, I was really impressed at how quickly it works.  I didn’t have to wait 30 days for it to kick in – on day one I got immediate results.  Now, I wasn’t expecting to lose weight, but I did!  Turns out Yacon Ease works much like a cleanse and keeps me feeling fuller longer, and it keeps my bowel movements regular.  Even my friends have noticed my new slim figure.  It’s nice having Yacon Ease.  I feel like my gut is just happy all the time now.”</blockquote>
